All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Unit tests mocking network errors and status codes.
- Comprehensive unit tests covering malformed payloads, trimming/deduplication, and partial-cache resilience.
- Manual data analysis script in `tools/analyze_api.py` for live API inspection.
- Support for `hmac_secret_key` in engine configuration and environment variables.

### Changed
- Switched networking from `urllib.request` to shared `searx.network.get` (httpx-style).
- Hardened payload validation (top-level list requirement, strict type checking for categories and scripts).
- Improved slug normalization using a new `_slugify` helper (NFKD normalization, lowercase, special character removal).
- Implemented slug collision handling using numeric suffixes (e.g., `slug-1`).
- Migrated from a single-blob cache to individual per-script cache entries.
- Switched cache serialization from `pickle` to compressed JSON (zlib level 6).
- Truncated script descriptions to 500 characters to optimize cache utilization within the 10 KB limit.
- Enhanced logging with informative warnings for malformed upstream data and cache failures.
- Refactored `setup()` to use a secure "load-or-generate" flow for per-instance HMAC keys.

### Fixed
- Logic error where disabled scripts reserved slugs and caused unnecessary renaming of enabled scripts.

### Security
- Replaced `pickle` with `json` for cache serialization to eliminate potential deserialization vulnerabilities.
- Added HMAC-based integrity protection for all cached script data.
- Configured `.gitignore` to prevent the instance-local `.hmac_secret` from being committed.
